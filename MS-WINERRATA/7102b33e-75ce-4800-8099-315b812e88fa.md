<p>&#9679; If the server
  supports Unicode (as indicated in Client.Connection.ServerCapabilities) the
  client MAY send the plaintext password in Unicode. The Unicode password is
  placed into the UnicodePassword field of the SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX

  padding is used. The UnicodePasswordLength field is set to the length, in
  bytes, of the Unicode password.</p>

  section 3.3.4.2, and either received a response or the OpLock break time-out
  has expired.&lt;259&gt; The server MUST have the OPLOCK_RELEASE flag set in
  the TypeofLock field of the request. The server MUST set the NewOplockLevel
  field of the request to 0x00. If the process holding the OpLock closes the
