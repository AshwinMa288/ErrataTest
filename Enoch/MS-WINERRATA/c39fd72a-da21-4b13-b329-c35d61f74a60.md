  <p>In Section 3.2.1.4.3.2.20   PropID = 0x00000014
  (CR_PROP_CRLSTATE) &quot;CA CRL State&quot;, clarified processing rules to
  better reflect the behavior that occurs when the client requests the CRL
  status of all CA signing certificates.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&#8203;Changed from:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The CA MUST do the following for each one of the rows
  in Signing_Cert table:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&#9679; The CA MUST evaluate the certificate (1)
  status stored in the Signing_Cert_Certificate column by building its chain
  based on the specification defined in [RFC3280].</p>
  <p>&#9679; If the certificate (1) is not valid the CA
  uses one of the status codes in the following table as the status for this
  signing certificate.</p>
  <p>&#9679; If the signing certificate is valid, the CA
  MUST evaluate the base CRL stored in the CRL_Raw_CRL column of the CRL table
  row where the value of CRL_Name_Id is equal to the row of the preceding
  signing certificate and verify that it was signed by the key (2) associated
  with the signing certificate stored in the Signing_Cert_Certificate column.
  If the signature does not match to the public key of the signing certificate,
  then the CA MUST return the status 0x01 as specified in the following table.</p>
  <p>&#9679; If the signing certificate is valid and its
  associated key (2) was used to sign the base CRL stored in the same row, the
  CA MUST return 0x03 as the status for this signing certificate.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed to:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The CA MUST do the following for each one of the rows
  in Signing_Cert table:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&#9679; The CA MUST evaluate the certificate (1)
  status stored in the Signing_Cert_Certificate column by building its chain
  based on the specification defined in [RFC3280].</p>
  <p>&#9679; If the signing certificate is revoked, the CA
  MUST return the status CA_DISP_REVOKED.</p>
  <p>&#9679; If the certificate (1) index (identified by
  the Signing_Cert_Certificate column) does not match the key (2) index, the CA
  MUST return the status CA_DISP_ERROR.</p>
  <p>&#9679; If the certificate (1) index (identified by
  Signing_Cert_Certificate column) matches the key (2) index, the CA MUST
  return the status CA_DISP_VALID.</p>
