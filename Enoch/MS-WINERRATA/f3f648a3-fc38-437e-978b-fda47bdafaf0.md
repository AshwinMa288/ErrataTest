  <p>In Section 3.1.5.2, Receiving a DHCPACK, added
  alternate processing for none or two route options.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed from:</p>
  <p>If it contains a Microsoft Classless Static Route
  Option, the client MUST first check whether the option conforms to the syntax
  specified in section 2.2.8. If any of the parameters in this DHCPv4 option
  are invalid or incomplete, the DHCPv4 client MUST silently discard the
  complete DHCPv4 message and start the initialization process again.
  Otherwise, the specified routes MUST be inserted into the routing table in
  the TCP/IP stack.</p>

  <p>If it contains a Microsoft Classless Static Route
  Option, the client MUST first check whether the option conforms to the syntax

  are invalid or incomplete, the DHCPv4 client MUST silently discard the

  Otherwise, if the DHCPACK does not contain a Classless Static Route Option
  (121), the specified routes MUST be inserted into the routing table in the
  TCP/IP stack. If it contains both a Microsoft Classless Static Route Option
  (249) and a Classless Static Route Option (121) then the client MUST select
  either (in any implementation-specific way[27]) set of routes as the routes
  to be added into the routing table in the TCP/IP stack.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&lt;27&gt; Section 3.1.5.2: All versions of Windows
  Vista and Windows Server 2008 and later will insert the last option in the
  message.</p>
