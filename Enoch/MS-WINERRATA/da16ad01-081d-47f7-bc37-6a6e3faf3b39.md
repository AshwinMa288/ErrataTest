  <p>In Section 1.2.1, Normative References, the following
  reference has been added:&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>[MS-XCA] Microsoft Corporation, &quot;Xpress
  Compression Algorithm&quot;. &#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>In Section 2.2.1.4.15, XPRESS Block, the Block Data
  field has been changed from:&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>If the value of the Block Compressed Size field is
  less than the value of the Block Uncompressed Size field, then the data has
  been compressed. For more information about decompressing compressed data,
  see section 3.1.1.1.3.9. &#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>Changed to:&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>If the value of the Block Compressed Size field is
  less than the value of the Block Uncompressed Size field, then the data has
  been compressed. For more information about decompressing compressed data,
  see section 3.1.1.2. &#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>In Section 3.1.1.1, Compression, the following was
  changed from:&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>Many of the FrsTransport methods use compression to
  reduce the amount of data that is returned to the client. This section
  describes algorithms and a conceptual model of possible data organization
  that an implementation maintains in order to decompress compressed data. The
  described organization is provided to facilitate the explanation of how the
  algorithm behaves. Error checking and handling has been omitted from all
  algorithms in the interests of clarity. This document does not mandate that
  implementations adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is
  consistent with what is described in this document.&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>Changed to&#8203;:</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>Many of the FrsTransport methods use the LZ77+Huffman
  Compression algorithm, specified in [MS-XCA] section 2.1, to compress data.
  This document does not mandate that implementations adhere to this model as
  long as their external behavior is consistent with what is described in this
  document.&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>The following sections have been removed and replaced
  with links to MS-XCA:</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.1 Pseudocode Conventions</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.2 Data Structures</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.2.1 PREFIX_CODE_NODE</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.2.2 PREFIX_CODE_SYMBOL</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.2.3 BITSTRING</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3 Procedures</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3.1 PrefixCodeTreeRebuild</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3.2 PrefixCodeTreeAddLeaf</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3.3 SortSymbols</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3.4 CompareSymbols</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3.5 BitstringInit</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3.6 BitstringLookup</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3.7 BitstreamSkip</p>
  <p>3.1.1.1.3.8 PrefixCodeTreeDecodeSymbol &#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>A new section, 3.1.1.2, Decompression, has been
  added:&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>FrsTransport methods that compress data will always
  return information specifying the size of the original data. It is the
  caller’s responsibility to determine whether the returned data is compressed.
  If the size of the compressed data buffer that is returned by the server in
  bytes is equal to the size in bytes of the original uncompressed data, then
  the buffer returned by the server contains uncompressed data.&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>In Section 3.2.4.1.7, RequestRecords (Opnum 6), the
  description of the compressedRecords field has been changed from:&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>compressedRecords: The data records, compressed using
  the DFS-R compression algorithm specified in section 3.1.1.1.&#8203;</p>
  <p>The compressedRecords bytes correspond to an array of
  FRS_ID_GVSN entries. DFS-R uses custom marshaling in this RPC call to
  compress the set of transmitted records. The size of the FRS_ID_GVSN array is
  given by the numRecords parameter. The decompression algorithm specified in
  section 3.1.1.1.3.9 can  be used to decompress the received data into a
  buffer of sizeof(FRS_ID_GVSN)*numRecords bytes, which can be re-interpreted
  as an array of FRS_ID_GVSN entries.&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>Changed to:&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>compressedRecords: The data records, compressed using
  the algorithm specified in section 3.1.1.1.&#8203;</p>
  <p>The compressedRecords bytes correspond to an array of
  FRS_ID_GVSN entries. DFS-R uses custom marshaling in this RPC call to
  compress the set of transmitted records. The size of the FRS_ID_GVSN array is
  given by the numRecords parameter. The decompression algorithm specified in
  section 3.1.1.1 can  be used to decompress the received data into a buffer of
  sizeof(FRS_ID_GVSN)*numRecords bytes, which can be re-interpreted as an array
  of FRS_ID_GVSN entries.&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>In Section 3.2.4.1.14, InitializeFileTransferAsync
  (Opnum 13), changed from:&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
  <p>2. An encapsulation of the marshaled file data stream
  using the compressed data format (as specified in section 3.2.4.1.14.2)
  generated by the DFS-R  compression algorithm specified in section 3.1.1.1.
  Even if the marshaled file data stream is not compressed by the server, it is
  still encapsulated using the compressed data format.&#8203;</p>
  <p>&#8203;</p>
