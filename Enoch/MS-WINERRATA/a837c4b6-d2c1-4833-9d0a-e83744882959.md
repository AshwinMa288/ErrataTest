  channel ID corresponds in position to the channels requested in the Client
  Network Data structure. A channel value of 0 indicates that the channel was

  <p> </p>
  <p>When using the Direct Approach, no negotiation of the
  security protocol takes place. The client and server are hard-coded to use
  the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) Protocol (section 5.4.5)
  when a connection is initiated. Once the security protocol handshake has
  completed successfully, the RDP Connection Sequence begins, starting with (a)
  the X.224 messages which form the Connection Initiation phase (section
  1.3.1.1); or (b) the Early User Authorization Result PDU (section 2.2.10.2)
  followed by the X.224 messages. From this point all RDP traffic is encrypted
  using the CredSSP External Security Protocol.</p>
  <p>The RDP Negotiation Request (section 2.2.1.1.1) will
  still be appended to the X.224 Connection Request PDU (section 2.2.1.1) and
  the requested protocol list will contain the identifier of the CredSSP
  protocol (section 2.2.1.1.1). If this is not the case, the server will append
  an RDP Negotiation Failure (section 2.2.1.2.2) to the X.224 Connection
  Confirm PDU (section 2.2.1.2) with a failure code of INCONSISTENT_FLAGS
  (0x04). Similarly, the server will indicate that the hard-coded security
  protocol is the selected protocol in the RDP Negotiation Response (section
  2.2.1.2.1) which is appended to the X.224 Connection Confirm PDU.</p>
