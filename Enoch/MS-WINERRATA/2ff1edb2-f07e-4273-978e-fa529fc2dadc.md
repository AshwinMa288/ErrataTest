  <p>In Section 2.2.2.6 RDPUDP_ACK_OF_ACKVECTOR_HEADER
  Structure, revised the field snAckofAcksSeqNum to snResetSeqNum, and updated

  <p>In Section 2.2.2.7 RDPUDP_ACK_VECTOR_HEADER Structure,
  revised structure description, field AckVectorElement to AckVector and added
  normative information to field definitions.</p>
  <p>Changed from:</p>
  <p>The RDPUDP_ACK_VECTOR_HEADER structure contains the
  ACK vector (section 2.2.3.1) that specifies the states of the datagram in the
  receiver’s queue. This vector is a variable-size array. The states are
  encoded by using run-length encoding (RLE) and are stored in this array.</p>
  <p><img id="Picture 401" src="ms-winerrata_files/image013.png"></p>
  <p>AckVectorElement (variable): An array of ACK Vector
  elements. Each element is composed of a state, and the number of contiguous
  datagrams that share the same state.</p>
  <p>Padding (variable): A variable-sized array, of length
  zero or more, such that this structure ends on a DWORD ([MS-DTYP] section
  2.2.9) boundary.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed to:</p>
  <p>The RDPUDP_ACK_VECTOR_HEADER structure contains a
  variable size array of ACK Vector Elements (section 2.2.2.7.1), referred to
  as the ACK vector.</p>
  <p>The ACK vector captures the state of the queue of
  Source Packets at the receiver endpoint. Each position in the queue can have
  two values that indicate whether a Source Packet is present in the queue, or
  not. Run-length encoding (RLE) compression is used to encode the state of
  Source Packets in the array.</p>
  <p><img id="Picture 402" src="ms-winerrata_files/image014.png"></p>
  <p>AckVector (variable): A variable size array of ACK
  Vector Elements (section 2.2.2.7.1). The size of the AckVector field is
  specified by the uAckVectorSize field.</p>
  <p>Padding (variable): A variable-sized array, of length
  zero or more, such that this structure ends on a DWORD ([MS-DTYP] section
  2.2.9) boundary.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Added section 2.2.2.7.1 ACK Vector Element. …</p>
  <p>An ACK Vector Element is an 8-bit structure. The two
  most significant bits of each element encode the VECTOR_ELEMENT_STATE
  enumeration (section 2.2.1.1), while the six least significant bits specify
  the length of a continuous sequence of datagrams that share the same state.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Removed sections 2.2.3 Vectors &amp; 2.2.3.1 ACK
  Vector.</p>
  <p>2.2.3     Vectors</p>
  <p>2.2.3.1  ACK Vector</p>
  <p>The ACK vector captures the state of the queue of
  Source Packets at the receiver endpoint.</p>
  <p>Each position in the queue can have two values that
  indicate whether a Source Packet is present in the queue, or not. The
  run-length encoding (RLE) compression is used for encoding the states of
  Source Packets in the array.</p>
  <p>An ACK Vector comprises a number of elements, as
  specified by the uAckVectorSize field in the RDPUDP_ACK_VECTOR_HEADER
  structure (section 2.2.2.7). Each element is 8 bits long.</p>
  <p><img id="Picture 403" src="ms-winerrata_files/image015.png"></p>
  <p>The ACK vectors form a binary large object (BLOB), and
  are padded so that they are aligned to WORD ([MS-DTYP] section 2.2.61)
  boundaries.</p>
  <p>This is similar to the description of ACK vectors in
  the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), as described in [RFC4341].</p>

  <p>. 3.1.1.4.1 Lost Datagrams</p>

  <p>The RDPUDP_SYNEX_PAYLOAD structure (section 2.2.2.9)

  the highest protocol version supported. This structure SHOULD NOT be appended
  if this datagram is in response to a SYN from the other endpoint where the
  RDP_FLAG_SYNEX flag was not specified. The uSynExFlags field MUST be set as

  <p>&#9679;The RDPUDP_SYNEX_PAYLOAD structure (section
  2.2.2.9) SHOULD only be present if it is also present in the received SYN
  packet. The uUdpVer field MUST be set to the highest RDP-UDP protocol version
  supported by both endpoints. The highest version supported by both endpoints,
  which is RDPUDP_PROTOCOL_VERSION_1 if either this packet or the SYN packet
  does not specify a version, is the version that MUST be used by both
  endpoints.</p>
