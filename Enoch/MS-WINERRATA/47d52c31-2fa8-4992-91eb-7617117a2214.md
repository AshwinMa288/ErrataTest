  <p>Added a new Section 2.3.31, FSCTL_MARK_HANDLE Request.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>2.3.31 FSCTL_MARK_HANDLE Request</p>
  <p>The FSCTL_MARK_HANDLE request is used to set specific
  operational state on the given file handle. This state is lost once the
  handle is closed.&lt;29&gt;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The MARK_HANDLE_INFO element is as follows:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img id="Picture 377" src="ms-winerrata_files/image006.png"></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>CopyNumber (4 bytes): A 32-bit unsigned integer that
  identifies, when reading from a file which resides on redundant media, which
  copy to read.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Unused (4 bytes): Reserved for alignment. This field
  can contain any value and MUST be ignored.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>VolumeHandle (8 bytes): A 64-bit HANDLE that is not
  used and MUST be set to zero.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>HandleInfo (4 bytes): A 32-bit unsigned integer
  containing flags to identify the request. Only one of the following values
  can be set:</p>

    <p>When this state is not set a file system will return
    data from any copy available as it sees fit. <br><br></p>
    <p>This operation is typically used by scrubber
    applications that want to validate the contents of all copies of data for a
    given file.</p>

  <p>Added a new Section 2.3.32, FSCTL_MARK_HANDLE.</p>

  <p>2.3.32 FSCTL_MARK_HANDLE Reply</p>
  <p>This message returns the results of the
  FSCTL_MARK_HANDLE request.</p>

  <p>The only data item this message returns is a status
  code, as specified in section 2.2. Upon success, the status code returned by
  the function that processes this FSCTL is STATUS_SUCCESS. The most common
  error codes are listed in the following table.</p>

  <p>In Section 2.7.1, FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION, the
  following was changed from:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ACTION_REMOVED</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>0x00000002   The file was removed from the directory.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ACTION_MODIFIED</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>0x00000003   The file was modified. This can be a

  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_OLD_NAME</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>0x00000004   The file was renamed, and this is the old
  name. If the new name resides within the directory being monitored, the
  client also receives the FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_NEW_NAME bit value as described
  in the next list item. If the new name resides outside of the directory being
  monitored, the client will not receive the FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_NEW_NAME bit
  value.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_NEW_NAME</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>0x00000005   The file was renamed, and this is the new
  name. If the old name resides within the directory being monitored, the
  client will also receive the FILE_ACTION_RENAME_OLD_NAME bit value. If the
  old name resides outside of the directory being monitored, the client will
  not receive the FILE_ACTION_RENAME_OLD_NAME bit value.</p>

  <p>Changed to:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ACTION_REMOVED</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>0x00000002   The file was removed from the directory.
  When a file is renamed to a different directory the client will receive this
  notification along with FILE_ACTION_MODIFIED.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ACTION_MODIFIED</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>0x00000003   The file was modified. This can be a
  change to the data or attributes of the file. When a file is renamed to a
  different directory the client will receive this notification along with
  FILE_ACTION_REMOVED.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_OLD_NAME</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>0x00000004   The file was renamed, and this is the old
  name. This notification is only sent when the rename operation does not
  change the directory the file resides in. The client will also receive a
  FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_NEW_NAME notification. This notification will not be received
  if the file is renamed to a different directory.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ACTION_RENAMED_NEW_NAME</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>0x00000005   The file was renamed, and this is the new
  name. This notification is only sent when the rename operation does not
  change the directory the file resides in. The client will also receive a
  FILE_ACTION_RENAME_OLD_NAME notification. This notification will not be
  received if the file is renamed to a different directory.</p>

  <p>In Section 6, Appendix B: Product Behavior, the
  following was changed in behavior note &lt;10&gt; Section 2.1.9 from:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>NTFS computes the 64-bit file ID as follows: 48 bits
  are the index of the file's primary record in the master file table (MFT),
  and the other 16 bits are a sequence number. Therefore, it is possible that a
  different file can have the same 64-bit file ID as a file on that volume had
  in the past.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed to</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>NTFS computes the 64-bit file ID as follows: the low
  48 bits are the index of the file's primary record in the master file table
  (MFT); the remaining 16 bits are a sequence number. Therefore, it is
  possible, though rare, that a different file can have the same 64-bit file ID
  as a file on that volume had in the past.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>ReFS maps a subset of the possible 128-bit file ID
  values to a 64-bit value using a reversible algorithm; for values outside of
  this subset, ReFS sets the 64-bit file ID to -1.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The following was added to behavior note &lt;11&gt; in
  Section 2.1.10:  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>NTFS computes the 128-bit file ID as follows: the low
  48 bits are the index of the file's primary record in the master file table
  (MFT), the next 16 bits are a sequence number, and the high 64 bits MUST be
  zero. Therefore, it is possible, though rare, that a different file can have
  the same 128-bit file ID as a file on that volume had in the past.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>ReFS computes the 128-bit file ID as follows: the low
  64 bits consists of an index uniquely identifying the file's parent directory
  on the volume. The high 64-bits consists of an index uniquely identifying the
  file within that directory.  </p>
