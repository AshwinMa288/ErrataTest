  <p>In Section 2.6    File Attributes, the following
  attributes have been added.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed to:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Value                    Meaning</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_OPEN</p>
  <p>0x00040000</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This attribute appears only in directory enumeration
  classes (FILE_DIRECTORY_INFORMATION, FILE_BOTH_DIR_INFORMATION, etc.). When
  this attribute is set, it means that the file or directory has no physical
  representation on the local system; the item is virtual. Opening the item
  will be more expensive than usual because it will cause at least some of the
  file or directory content to be fetched from a remote store. This attribute
  can only be set by kernel-mode components. This attribute is for use with
  hierarchical storage management software.&lt;162&gt;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_PINNED</p>
  <p>0x00080000</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This attribute indicates user intent that the file or
  directory should be kept fully present locally even when not being actively
  accessed. This attribute is for use with hierarchical storage management
  software.&lt;163&gt;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_UNPINNED</p>
  <p>0x00100000</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This attribute indicates that the file or directory
  should not be kept fully present locally except when being actively accessed.
  This attribute is for use with hierarchical storage management
  software.&lt;164&gt;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_RECALL_ON_DATA_ACCESS</p>
  <p>0x00400000</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When this attribute is set, it means that the file or
  directory is not fully present locally. For a file this means that not all of
  its data is on local storage (for example, it may be sparse with some data
  still in remote storage). For a directory it means that some of the directory
  contents are being virtualized from another location. Reading the file or
  enumerating the directory will be more expensive than usual because it will
  cause at least some of the file or directory content to be fetched from a
  remote store. Only kernel-mode callers can set this attribute. This attribute
  is for use with hierarchical storage management software.&lt;165&gt;</p>

  <p>In Section 2.4.34 FileRenameInformation, the
  description of STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER and STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED have been
  updated.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed from:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER: An invalid parameter was
  passed for FileName or FileNameLength, or the target file was open, or the
  RootDirectory field value was nonzero for a network operation.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED: The handle was not opened with
  delete access.</p>

  <p> </p>

  delete access, or the target file was open and ReplaceIfExists is nonzero.</p>

  <p>In MS-FSCC Section 2.4.34.2   FileRenameInformation
  for SMB2, the Padding field was added to the end of the packet:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed from:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FileName (variable): A sequence of Unicode characters
  containing the new name of the file. When working with this field, use
  FileNameLength to determine the length of the file name rather than assuming
  the presence of a trailing null delimiter.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>Padding (variable): Length of this field MUST be the
  number of bytes required to make the size of this structure at least 24. This
  field MAY be set to 0 and MUST be ignored on receipt.</p>
