  that uniquely identifies the multitransport connection; it contains a request
  ID and a cookie, a protocol identifier that identifies the type of
  multitransport connection that the client attempts to establish, and a port
  number that identifies the port on which the server is listening. When the
  client receives the Initiate Multitransport Request PDU, it attempts to
  establish a secure multitransport connection with the server.</p>
