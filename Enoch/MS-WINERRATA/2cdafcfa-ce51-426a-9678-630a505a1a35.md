  <p>&lt;133&gt; Section 3.2.4.9: In a SET_INFO request
  where FileInfoClass is set to FileRenameInformation, and the size of the
  buffer is less than 24, Windows clients pad the buffer to 24 bytes. These
  padding bytes are set to arbitrary values. Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server
  2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 clients append up to 4 additional
  padding bytes set to arbitrary values.</p>

  <p>In Section 3.3.5.9 Receiving an SMB2 CREATE Request,
  the following was updated</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed from:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the file name length is greater than zero and the
  first character is a path separator character, the server MUST fail the
  request with STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER. If the file name fails to conform with
  the specification of a relative pathname in [MS-FSCC] section 2.1.5, the
  server MUST fail the request with STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_INVALID.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed to:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the file name in the Buffer field of the request
  fails to resolve the pathname components as specified in [MS-FSCC] section
  2.1.5.1, the server SHOULD&lt;262&gt; fail the request with
  STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&lt;262&gt; Section 3.3.5.9: Windows-based servers
  fail the CREATE request with STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER if the file name in the
  Buffer field of the request begins in the form &quot;subfolder\..\&quot;, for
  example &quot;x\..\y.txt&quot;.</p>
