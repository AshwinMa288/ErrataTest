  <p>MDM, both as defined in this document and the OMA-DM
  protocol [OMA-DMP1.2.1], uses HTTP (as specified in [RFC2616]) as the
  transport layer. MDM, in compliance with [OMA-SyncML-HTTPBnd], supports both
  “application/vnd.syncml.dm+xml” (default) and “application/vnd.syncml.dm+wbxml”
  encoding types. The server can be configured with the DMAcc Configuration
  Service Provider’s Microsoft/DefaultEncoding, as described in
  [DMC-DMAcc-CSP]. HTTP operations are performed on resources identified by a
  URI. MDM extends the resource addressing rules used by HTTP for URI
  formatting as specified in section 2.2.3.</p>

  <p>In Section 4, Examples, an unneeded XML header line in
  the middle of the example was deleted.</p>
