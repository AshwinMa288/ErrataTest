  <p>In 9 sections - Section 2, Message Syntax,
  through  Section 2.2.1.2.3.1, TSRemoteGuardPackageCred - added behavior
  notes to indicate character encoding and each data type with ASN.1 data type
  in each field as unsigned integer encoded as ASN.1 INTEGER or ASN.1 OCTET
  STRING.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Added the following Product Note in or after each
  introduction:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&lt;n&gt; Where data is a text string, Windows uses a
  Unicode string defined by a UNICODE_STRING structure to encode to ASN.1 OCTET
  STRING format. For more information see [MSDOCS-UNICODE_STRING]. For a
  description of Octet String see [MS-DTYP] and [X690].</p>

  <p>In Section 2.2.1,TSRequest, added a product behavior
  note that TLS requires messages only be fragmented at TLS's maximum message
  length.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed from:</p>
  <p>. . .The TSRequest message, section 2.2.1, is always
  sent over the TLS-encrypted channel between the client and server in a
  CredSSP Protocol exchange (see step 1 in section 3.1.5).</p>

  CredSSP Protocol exchange (see step 1 in section 3.1.5).&lt;8&gt;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&lt;8&gt; Section 2.2.1: The CredSSP standard requires
  that a TLS encrypted message fragment contain an entire ASN.1 message.
  CredSSP expects that the entire first tag and length to fall in the initial
  block of decrypted data and for the client to encrypt TSRequest messages as
  single blocks subject only to fragmentation at TLS’s maximum message length.
  The CredSSP server expects a TLS encryption of an entire TSRequest message
  without fragmentation. Otherwise, the server returns an error.</p>

  <p>In Section 3.1.5, Processing Events and Sequencing

  <p>Changed from:</p>
  <p>1. The CredSSP client and CredSSP server first
  complete the TLS handshake, as specified in [RFC2246]. After the handshake is
  complete, all subsequent CredSSP Protocol messages are encrypted by the TLS
  channel. The CredSSP Protocol does not extend the TLS wire protocol. As part
  of the TLS handshake, the CredSSP server does not request the client's X.509
  certificate (thus far, the client is anonymous).</p>

  <p>In Section 2.2.1.2.3.1, TSRemoteGuardPackageCred,
  clarified data structures and processing in product note 12.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed from:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In Windows, logon credentials (in the logonCred field
  of TSRemoteGuardCreds) are required in the KERB_TICKET_LOGON structure where
  the KRB_CRED message ([RFC4120], section 5.8.1) in the TicketGrantingTicket
  member is using the KERB_RPC_ENCRYPTION_KEY ([MS-RDPEAR] section 2.2.1.2.1)
  for the EncryptionKey. Supplemental credentials (in the supplementalCreds
  field of TSRemoteGuardCreds) are required  in the following structure:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed to:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In Windows, the logon credentials that are in the
  logonCred field of TSRemoteGuardCreds structure are required to be in a
  KERB_TICKET_LOGON structure ([KERB-TICKET-LOGON]). The TicketGrantingTicket
  member within the KERB_TICKET_LOGON structure is an ASN.1-encoded KRB_CRED
  message ([RFC4120], section 5.8.1). The EncryptionKey in KrbCredInfo ([RFC4120],
  section 5.8.1) is required to be in a KERB_RPC_ENCRYPTION_KEY structure
  ([MS-RDPEAR] section 2.2.1.2.1). The ServiceTicket member within the
  KERB_TICKET_LOGON structure is a ticket to the computer account. Windows
  CredSSP clients will use Kerberos User to User tickets ([RFC4120], section
  2.9.2) as the ServiceTicket, but the server does not enforce this. The
  session key of the ServiceTicket is used to encrypt the EncryptedData in the
  KRB_CRED message.</p>
