  <p>Added new Section 5.1.1.6  Authentication
  Expiration, to clarify the conditions under which a DC uses the expiry
  time of a connection to initiate disconnection of such a connection, and in
  the specific case of a new LDAP request on an existing connection with an
  elapsed expiry time, to subsequently send a Notice of Disconnection; as specified
  by the included ASN.1 definition.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Changed to:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>5.1.1.6   Authentication Expiration</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the authentication method used to establish a
  connection specifies an expiry time, the DC MUST associate the expiry time
  with the connection. The expiry time is then used as follows: A DC MUST
  disconnect connections having expiry times in a given period of time
  following the expiry time. Although the protocol places no boundary or other
  requirement on the length of the given time period, it is recommended that
  implementations minimize the length of the time period to improve client
  usability of the directory. </p>

  <p>In Section 3.1.1.5.3.3 Processing Specifics, specified
  the server operations that MUST occur whenever an msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName
  attribute is added or when one is removed. Added new Normative Reference:
  [MSKB-4505903].</p>

  <p>&quot;If any of the operations above fail, then the
  modify returns unwillingToPerform. This processing rule is not supported by
  ADAM RTW DCs.</p>
  <p>In AD DS, if the msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName attribute
  is modified, additional operations are performed as follows. These steps assume
  the value(s) added or deleted are in the form anyDnsLabel.suffix:</p>
  <p>For each msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName attribute value
  that is being added, the server MUST add a value to the
  msDS-AdditionalSamAccountName attribute in the format ‘anyDnsLabel$’.</p>
  <p>Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, and Windows
  Server v1903 operating system without [MSKB-4505903] installed, will add the
  'anyDnsLabel$' value to the msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName attribute.</p>
  <p>For each msDS-AdditionalDnsHostName value that is
  being removed, the server MUST check for a corresponding ‘anyDnsLabel$’ value
  in the msDS-AdditionalSamAccountName attribute, and if found, remove it.</p>
